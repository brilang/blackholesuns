Be warned! Here there be spoilers. This is the last thing you should be doing in No Man's Sky, not the first.

## Troubleshooting

Welcome, Interloper! If you are having trouble finding a route to your favorite destination, there is help. Ask a question on [the BlackHoleSuns discord server](https://discord.blackholesuns.com).

### Site Hangs When I Press Go!

You press _Go!_ and the site gets stuck thinking. If you wait about 20 minutes it finishes with a route that no one would ever want to travel.

The "hanging" part of this is a known issue. We're working on a fix.

This happens because there is no good route. In other words, the best route from start to destination is really long. To fix this, you need to start from a better place.

"How do I do that?" Funny you should ask.

## Finding a Good Start

Because of the geometry of the galaxy and the way black holes take you long distances _around_ the center but not _towards_ it, your start needs to be about the same distance from the center as your destination.

Specifically, your start should be about 15,000 LY to 30,000 LY further from center than your destination. This should minimize unnecessary extra black hole jumps forward or, worse, hyper-jumps away from center.

**Tip:** As you explore the galaxy, set up small bases at 50,000 LY intervals from center. If you do this, a good path is just a teleport away!

## Traveler's Checklist

Before you travel, make sure you've packed the essentials and your travel plans are in order. Here is a list of what you'll need.

- **Hyperspace Starship** (required): A 38x12 S-class explorer maxed out on hyperspace upgrades
  - 2000 LY jump range minimum recommended
- **Black Hole Starship** (optional): A 32x12 S-class fighter or explorer, technology slots maxed out
  - upgrades in normal inventory slots are damaged by black hole travel, but technology slots are safe
  - alternative is to use a junker
- **16 Glyphs** (required): You can't set a waypoint if you can use a portal
- **Access to Black Holes** (required): This one should be obvious
- **Freighter** (optional): Highly recommended
- **A Good Start Point** (required): See section above.
